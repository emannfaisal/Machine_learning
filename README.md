 Project Overview:This project aims to predict the forest cover type (the predominant kind of tree) for 30 x 30 meter cells based on cartographic variables. The dataset is the UCI Forest Cover Type, which includes over 581,000 observations of seven different forest types in the Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.📊 Dataset FeaturesThe model utilizes 54 initial attributes, including:Quantitative: Elevation, Aspect, Slope, Distances to Hydrology, Roadways, and Fire Points.Categorical (One-Hot Encoded): 4 Wilderness Areas and 40 Soil Types.Target: Cover_Type (Classes 1 through 7).🛠️ Data Preprocessing & EngineeringTo optimize model performance and memory usage, the following steps were implemented:Label Refinement: Adjusted target labels from [1-7] to [0-6] to ensure compatibility with standard loss functions.Memory Optimization: Downcast binary features to int8 and continuous features to float32, reducing RAM usage by over 70%.Feature Engineering: Created a new feature, Distance_To_Hydrology_Euclidean, using the Pythagorean theorem:$$Distance = \sqrt{\text{Horizontal}^2 + \text{Vertical}^2}$$Zero-Variance Check: Verified that all features contained useful information (no constant columns).🤖 Modeling Strategy: Random ForestI utilized the Random Forest Classifier due to its robustness against outliers and ability to handle high-dimensional tabular data without the need for intensive scaling.Iteration 1: Baseline ModelOverall Accuracy: 89.14%Key Finding: While overall accuracy was high, the model suffered from a low Recall (0.39) for Class 4 (minority class). This indicated the model was biased toward majority classes.Iteration 2: Balanced ModelModification: Implemented class_weight='balanced'.
 Overall Accuracy: 90.10%Key Finding: Significant improvement in fairness. Class 4 Recall improved from 0.39 to 0.93, and the Macro F1-Score improved from 0.84 to 0.86.
